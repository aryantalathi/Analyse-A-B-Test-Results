# Analyse-A-B-Test-Results

(This project is a part of *Pratical Statistics* course of the *Data Analyst Nanodegree* by Udacity.)

### Project Overview
We will analyse the results of A/B tests conducted by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert". The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

* Implement the new webpage,
* Keep the old webpage, or
* Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

### What I learnt from this project
This project was conducted to test the knowledge of sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, significance of z-scores and p-values and implementation of Regression algorithms.
